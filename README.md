# nbn-speed-test-semi-automated-logger
Semi Automated Logger for doing speed tests for iiNet

An attempt to make my life easier for doing the tests at https://iihelp.iinet.net.au/support/node/14495
A rough script to automate the process of getting and saving the data to files in the expected (by NBNCo) format.

*TODO:* 
- fix saving of timestamps
- improve layout/UI
- input checking
